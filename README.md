OpenGINXplore is a frontend web application for exploring structured government information in a clear, discoverable, and visual way.

It provides a unified interface for navigating entities, their relationships, hierarchies, and historical changes over time, allowing users to understand how institutions, roles, and structures evolve.

OpenGINXplore consumes the [GI-Service](https://github.com/LDFLK/GI-SERVICE) (Backend-for-Frontend), which exposes [OpenGIN-based](https://github.com/LDFLK/OpenGIN) structured data through a set of tailored APIs optimized for frontend exploration and visualization.

This application serves as a sample government exploration app, using data related to the Government of Sri Lanka as a reference implementation. While the current dataset used is Sri Lanka–specific, the application is designed to be adaptable to any domain that follows the OpenGIN data model.

## Getting Started

### Installation & Setup

#### Prerequisite

- Node V20+
- Git

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LDFLK/openginxplore.git
cd openginxplore
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configuration**

Create a `config.js` file in the `public` directory
```
// for production update the config.js file in deployment pipeline
window.configs = {
    apiUrl: "<opengin_service>",
    apiUrlData: "<bff_service>",
    feedbackFormUrl: "<feedback_form_url>",
    version: "<version>",
    dataSources: "<data_sources>"
};

// for development
window.configs = {
  apiUrl: "",
  apiUrlData: "/api",
};
```

4. **Run the Application (development)**

##### Using Terminal

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`

5. **Config local proxy (React vite apps)**

If you encounter a CORS error, configure a local proxy in the `vite.config.js` file.

Update `server` block in the `vite.config.js` file.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
    base: '/', 
    plugins: [react()],
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
        },
    },
    server: {
        proxy: {
        '/v1': {
            target: 'http://localhost:8081',
            changeOrigin: true,
            secure: false,
        },
        '/api': {
            target: 'http://localhost:8000',
            changeOrigin: true,
            secure: false,
            rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
        },
        },
  },
})
```

## Configuration

Update the `config.js` file in the `public` directory

| Variable | Required | Description | Default |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `apiUrl` | `Yes` | Query (Read) OpenGIN service URL | `http://localhost:8081` |
| `apiUrlData` | `Yes` | GI-Service URL | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `feedbackFormUrl` | `No` | Feedback Form URL | `empty` |
| `version` | `No` | Application Version | `rc-1.0.0` |
| `dataSources` | `No` | Data Sources | `https://data.gov.lk/` |
